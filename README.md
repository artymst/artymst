Hey there!  
I'm an experimental developer who loves building things that mix creativity, code, and education.  
I’ve worked on **NovaScript**, my own simple, educational programming language built to help people understand how coding works from the ground up.

## 🧠 What I Do
- **Language Design:** Created *NovaScript*, an easy-to-learn educational coding language that encourages experimentation and learning.  
- **Web Development:** Explore web-first tools and technologies for interactive learning experiences.  
- **Graphic & UI/UX Design:** Craft clean, functional designs using **Figma**, **Framer**, and **Vercel**.  
- **Creative Experiments:** I enjoy pushing the limits of what’s possible with minimal tools and lots of curiosity.
